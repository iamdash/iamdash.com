<p>I have been working with the web in some way shape or form since immigrating to the UK from Cape Town in early 2003. My last position, before
    saying goodbye to the world of full-time employment, was as senior developer at <a href="http://www.icodesign.com/" title="www.icodesign.com">ico Design 
        Consultancy</a> in Central London where I had had held the position for four years.</p>

<p>While at ico, I had the opportunity to work on some brilliant projects ranging from front end development for
    <a href="http://www.wellcomecollection.org/" title="www.wellcomecollection.org">The Wellcome Collection</a>, run by the Wellcome Trust,
    and the <a href="http://www.nrm.org.uk/" title="www.nrm.org.uk">National Railway Museum</a> through to CMS and web-based software development and 
    technical production and management for &#8220;<a href="http://www.scienceof.com/507/the-science-of-survival/the-science-of-survival.html" title="www.scienceof.com">The Science Of&#8230; Survival</a>&#8220; interactive exhibition.</p>

<p>Apart from the obvious web development side of things, the variety of tasks and varying levels of involvement in each project at ico exposed me to all sides of a project, such as dealing with
    clients or managing a team of developers.</p>
