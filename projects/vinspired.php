                <p>I was sole front- and back-end developer (working with a Flash developer) on this interactive website for the BIMA award-winning interactive installation, Voicebot, a robot that communicated with a website to write out messages ("What do you care about?") submitted by visitors. The robot was placed in Parliament for a week in front of MPs and photos of each message written out were then uploaded to flickr.</p>
