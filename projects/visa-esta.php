        <p>&ldquo;The Electronic System of Travel Authorisation (ESTA) is a way of fast-tracking visitors to the USA from certain trusted nations by eliminating the paperwork of visa application.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>The website allowed travellers to apply for the ESTA Visa through a third party company. The site consisted of several informational pages with the main focal point being the application process and form.</p>
            <p>A bespoke CMS allowed the client to manage the application process as well as site content and the content of emails sent to customers.</p>
            <p>Online payments we made possible through integration of the Sage pay payment gateway.</p>
